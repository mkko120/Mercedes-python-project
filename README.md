# Mercedes-python-project

I made a thing. 

Recently my friend told me about Mercedes's LOL chest raffle which to enter you needed to get at least 2000 points on their [game](https://join.stagecast.io?code=3425).
He needed to quickly get the required amount of points so he reached out for help. 

With the help of stackoverflow I have found a [python library](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) that can automaticly detect and click objects on screen. With a few lines of code I was able to achieve over 4.5k points. Here is the script, adjust it for your liking.





# How to run

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

```bash
python <name of the script>
```

# How to compile 

```bash
python -m compileall <name of the script>
```

> Why compile?
>
> cuz its faster
